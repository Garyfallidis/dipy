Tissue Classification for a T1-weighted Strutural Image
=======================================================
This example explains how to segment a T1-weighted structural image using a MRF
approach. Similar algorithms have been proposed by Zhang et al. [Zhang2001]_,
and Avants et al. [Avants2011]_ available in FAST-FSL and ANTS-Artropos,
respectively.

Here we will use a T1-weighted image, that has been previously skull-stripped
and bias field corrected.

First we fetch the T1 volume from the Syn dataset

We can have a look at a axial slice of the image

Now we will define the other three parameters for the segmentation algorith
We will segment CSF, WM and GM (three classes) and we must add the background
First, the number of tissue classes

called classify with the correspondings inputs.
