DiPy for Debian
---------------

Documentation uses snapshots which require rendering on GLX capable X,
thus are difficult to render during documentation building.  Therefore
we ship upstream-provided dipy_*.orig-doc-examples.tar.gz with
renderings of the images.  See get-orig-upstream of debian/rules.
