# R (random) neighbours, (b) fewer tracks with a small number of close R
# tracks, and (c) a long tail showing how the R sample has over-sampled
# in dense parts of the tractography, coming up with several rather
# similar tracks. By contast the QB tracks are dissimilar by design - or
# can be thought of as more evenly distributed in track space.

# QB subset by comparison with the Random one
